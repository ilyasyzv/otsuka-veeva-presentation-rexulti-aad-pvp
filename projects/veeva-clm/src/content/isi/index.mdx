<p className='blue mb-6'>INDICATIONS</p>
<p className='mb-6'>ABILIFY MAINTENA is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for:</p>
<ul>
  <li className='mb-0'>
    Treatment of schizophrenia in adults
  </li>
  <li className='mb-0'>
    Maintenance monotherapy treatment of bipolar I
    disorder in adults
  </li>
</ul>
<p className='blue mt-16'>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</p>
<p className='blue mt-16 mb-10'>WARNING: INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS</p>
<p><strong>ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS TREATED WITH ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS ARE AT INCREASED RISK OF
  DEATH (1.6 TO 1.7 TIMES) COMPARED TO PLACEBO-TREATED PATIENTS. ABILIFY MAINTENA IS NOT APPROVED FOR THE TREATMENT OF
  PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contraindication:</strong> Known hypersensitivity reaction to aripiprazole. Reactions have ranged from
  pruritus/urticaria to anaphylaxis.</p>
<p><strong>Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke:</strong> Increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse
  events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, have been reported in clinical trials of
  elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with oral aripiprazole.</p>
<p><strong>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (Nms):</strong> NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex reported in
  association with administration of antipsychotic drugs including ABILIFY MAINTENA. Clinical signs of NMS are
  hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability. Additional signs may
  include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. Manage NMS with
  immediate discontinuation of ABILIFY MAINTENA, intensive symptomatic treatment, and monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Tardive Dyskinesia (Td):</strong> Risk of TD, and the potential to become irreversible, are believed to
  increase with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs. TD can develop after a
  relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses, or after discontinuation of treatment. Prescribing should be
  consistent with the need to minimize TD. If antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn, TD may remit, partially or
  completely.</p>
<p><strong>Metabolic Changes:</strong> Atypical antipsychotic drugs have caused metabolic changes including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus:</strong> Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with
    ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics
    including aripiprazole. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored for worsening of glucose
    control; those with risk factors for diabetes (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes), should undergo baseline
    and periodic fasting blood glucose testing. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for
    symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of
    hyperglycemia should also undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the
    atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment
    despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dyslipidemia:</strong> Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with
    atypical antipsychotics.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Weight Gain:</strong> Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring
    of weight is recommended.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pathological Gambling And Other Compulsive Behaviors:</strong> Intense urges, particularly for gambling, and
  the inability to control these urges have been reported while taking aripiprazole. Other compulsive urges have been
  reported less frequently. Prescribers should ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or intense
  compulsive urges. Consider dose reduction or stopping aripiprazole if such urges develop.</p>
<p><strong>Orthostatic Hypotension:</strong> ABILIFY MAINTENA may cause orthostatic hypotension and should be used with
  caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose
  them to hypotension.</p>
<p><strong>Falls:</strong> Antipsychotics may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability,
  which may lead to falls causing fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications
  that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating treatment and recurrently during
  therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Leukopenia, Neutropenia, And Agranulocytosis:</strong> Leukopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been
  reported with antipsychotics. Monitor complete blood count in patients with pre-existing low white blood cell count
  (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count or history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Discontinue ABILIFY MAINTENA at the
  first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC and in severely neutropenic patients.</p>
<p><strong>Seizures:</strong> ABILIFY MAINTENA should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or
  with conditions that lower the seizure threshold.</p>
<p><strong>Potential For Cognitive And Motor Impairment:</strong> ABILIFY MAINTENA may impair judgment, thinking, or
  motor skills. Instruct patients to avoid operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are certain
  ABILIFY MAINTENA does not affect them adversely.</p>
<p><strong>Body Temperature Regulation:</strong> Use ABILIFY MAINTENA with caution in patients who may experience
  conditions that increase body temperature (e.g., strenuous exercise, extreme heat, dehydration, or concomitant use
  with anticholinergics).</p>
<p><strong>Dysphagia:</strong> Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with ABILIFY MAINTENA. Use
  caution in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.</p>
<p><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Advise patients to avoid alcohol while taking ABILIFY MAINTENA.</p>
<p><strong>Concomitant Medication:</strong> Dosage adjustments are recommended in patients who are CYP2D6 poor
  metabolizers and in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP2D6 inhibitors for greater than 14 days. Avoid
  concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with ABILIFY MAINTENA for greater than 14 days. Dosage adjustments are not
  recommended for patients with concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP2D6 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers for less than
  14 days.</p>
<p><strong>Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions:</strong> The most commonly observed adverse reactions with ABILIFY
  MAINTENA in patients with schizophrenia (incidence ≥5% and at least twice that for placebo) were increased weight,
  akathisia, injection site pain, and sedation.</p>
<p><strong>Injection Site Reactions:</strong> In a short-term, clinical trial with ABILIFY MAINTENA in patients with
  schizophrenia treated with gluteal administered ABILIFY MAINTENA, the percent of patients reporting any injection
  site-related adverse reaction was 5.4%, and 0.6% for placebo. In an open label study of ABILIFY MAINTENA administered
  in the deltoid or gluteal muscle, injection site pain was observed at approximately equal rates.</p>
<p><strong>Dystonia:</strong> Symptoms of dystonia may occur in susceptible individuals during the first days of
  treatment and at low doses.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY MAINTENA, during the third
  trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms. Consider the benefits and risks of
  ABILIFY MAINTENA and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing ABILIFY MAINTENA to a pregnant woman. Advise
  pregnant women of potential fetal risk.</p>
<p><strong>Lactation:</strong> Aripiprazole is present in human breast milk. A decision should be made whether to
  discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother and any
  potential risks to the infant.</p>
