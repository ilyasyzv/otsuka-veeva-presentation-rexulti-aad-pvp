  WARNING: INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED
  PSYCHOSIS
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph weight={'bold'}>
  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic
  drugs are at increased risk of death (1.6 to 1.7 times) <br />
  compared to placebo-treated patients. ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA is not approved for
  the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Contraindication:</strong> Known hypersensitivity reaction to
  aripiprazole. Reactions have ranged from pruritus/urticaria to anaphylaxis.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke:</strong> Increased
  incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic
  attack), including fatalities, have been reported in clinical trials of
  elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with oral
  <br />
  aripiprazole.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):</strong> NMS is a potentially
  fatal symptom complex reported in association with administration of
  antipsychotic drugs including ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA. Clinical signs of NMS are
  hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and <br />
  evidence of autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine
  phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and <br />
  acute renal failure. Manage NMS with immediate discontinuation of
  ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA, intensive symptomatic treatment, and monitoring.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Tardive Dyskinesia (TD):</strong> Risk of TD, and the potential to
  become irreversible, are believed to increase with duration of treatment and
  total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs. TD can develop after a
  relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses, or after discontinuation
  <br />
  of treatment. Prescribing should be consistent with the need to minimize TD.
  If antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn, TD may remit,
  <br /> partially or completely.

  <strong>Metabolic Changes:</strong> Atypical antipsychotic drugs have caused
  metabolic changes including:

            <strong>Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus:</strong> Hyperglycemia, in
            some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar
            coma, or
            <br /> death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics
            including aripiprazole. Patients with diabetes mellitus should
            <br /> be regularly monitored for worsening of glucose control;
            those with risk factors for diabetes (e.g., obesity, family history
            of diabetes),
            <br /> should undergo baseline and periodic fasting blood glucose testing.
            Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be
            <br /> monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia,
            polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms
            <br /> of hyperglycemia should also undergo fasting blood glucose testing.
            In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical
            <br /> antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients
            required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite
            discontinuation of
            <br /> the suspect drug.

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Pathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviors:</strong> Intense
  urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges
  <br />
  have been reported while taking aripiprazole. Other compulsive urges have been
  reported less frequently. Prescribers should ask patients
  <br /> or their caregivers about the development of new or intense compulsive urges.
  Consider dose reduction or stopping aripiprazole if such
  <br /> urges develop.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Orthostatic Hypotension:</strong> ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA may cause
  orthostatic hypotension and should be used with caution in patients with known
  <br />
  cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would
  predispose them to hypotension.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Falls:</strong> Antipsychotics may cause somnolence, postural
  hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls causing
  fractures
  <br /> or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications
  that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assesments
  <br /> when initiating treatment and recurrently during therapy.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis:</strong> Leukopenia,
  neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported with antipsychotics.
  <br />
  Monitor complete blood count in patients with pre-existing low white blood
  cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count or history of drug-
  <br />
  Induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Discontinue ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA at the first
  sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC and in severely
  <br /> neutropenic patients.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Seizures:</strong> ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA should be used with caution
  in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the
  seizure threshold.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment:</strong> ABILIFY
  MAINTENA may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Instruct patients to
  <br />
  avoid operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are
  certain ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA does not affect them adversely.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Body Temperature Regulation:</strong> Use ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA with
  caution in patients who may experience conditions that increase body
  <br />
  temperature (e.g., strenuous exercise, extreme heat, dehydration, or
  concomitant use with anticholinergics).
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Dysphagia:</strong> Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been
  associated with ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA. Use caution in patients at risk for
  <br />
  aspiration pneumonia.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Alcohol:</strong> Advise patients to avoid alcohol while taking
  ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Concomitant Medication:</strong> Dosage adjustments are recommended in
  patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and in patients taking
  <br /> concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP2D6 inhibitors for greater than 14 days.
  Avoid concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with
  <br /> ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA for greater than 14 days. Dosage adjustments are
  not recommended for patients with concomitant use of CYP3A4
  <br /> inhibitors, CYP2D6 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers for less than 14 days.

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions:</strong> The most commonly
  observed adverse reactions with ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA in patients with
  <br />
  schizophrenia (incidence ≥5% and at least twice that for placebo) were
  increased weight, akathisia, injection site pain, and sedation.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Injection Site Reactions:</strong> In a short-term, clinical trial
  with ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA in patients with schizophrenia treated with gluteal
  <br />
  administered ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA, the percent of patients reporting any
  injection site-related adverse reaction was 5.4%, and 0.6% for
  <br /> placebo. In an open label study of ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA administered in
  the deltoid or gluteal muscle, injection site pain was observed at
  <br /> approximately equal rates.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Dystonia:</strong> Symptoms of dystonia may occur in susceptible
  individuals during the first days of treatment and at low doses.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including
  ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for
  <br />
  extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms. Consider the benefits and risks of
  ABILIFY&nbsp;MAINTENA and possible risks to the fetus when
  <br /> prescribing ABILIFY MAINTENA to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women
  of potential fetal risk.
</Paragraph>

{' '}

<Paragraph>
  <strong>Lactation:</strong> Aripiprazole is present in human breast milk. A
  decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the
  <br />
  drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother and any
  potential risks to the infant.
